<p data-start="1829" data-end="1996">This isn't about going viral with one lucky video. It's about <strong data-start="1891" data-end="1913">sustainable growth</strong>, building an audience that trusts you, and turning that audience into real income.</p>

<p data-start="4242" data-end="4441">The very first module gave me clarity on my niche, which had been a struggle for months. By the end of week two, I had my first few videos live&mdash;and to my surprise, they were getting real engagement.</p>
